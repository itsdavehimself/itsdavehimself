### Hey, I'm David 👋

I got into web development during the MySpace days, back when tweaking CSS meant having the coolest profile on your Top 8. Over the years, I’ve explored design, 3D, and all kinds of creative tech projects, which eventually pulled me deeper into building for the web.

These days, I mostly write TypeScript and work with modern web stacks. I’m expanding my skills into DevOps: learning AWS, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and best practices for scalable systems. Always building, always leveling up.
