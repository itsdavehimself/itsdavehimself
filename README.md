### Hey, I'm David 👋

I accidentally fell into web dev back in the myspace days, just a kid tweaking CSS to flex a cooler profile. Didn’t know it was “a real job” until way later. Fast forward: I’ve spent the last decade bouncing between creative projects, code, design, 3D, and tech rabbit holes. Turns out my journey led me to build cool web experiences.

These days, I mostly write TypeScript, but I'm shifting gears into DevOps: AWS, infra as code, CI/CD, observability, the whole stack.
Trying to go from “look what I built” to “look how it scales.”
