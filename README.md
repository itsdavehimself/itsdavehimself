### Hey, I'm David 👋

I fell into web development during the MySpace days, just a kid tweaking CSS to show off a cooler profile. I didn’t know it could be a real job. Fast forward: I’ve spent years bouncing between code, design, 3D, and all kinds of creative rabbit holes. Now I'm channeling that experience into building reliable, thoughtful web experiences.

Right now, I mostly write TypeScript and I'm working toward a DevOps path: AWS, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, observability, the whole stack.
I’m trying to go from “look what I built” to “look how it scales.”
