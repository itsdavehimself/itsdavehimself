### Hey, I'm David 👋

Without realizing it, I stumbled into web development during the MySpace era, tweaking layouts without realizing it could become a job. So, the next decade of my life was spent delving into and honing various seemingly disparate skills. However, the rise of accessible technology unveiled the potential to weave these skills together. I aspire to craft truly unforgettable online experiences alongside innovative collaborators. Proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript, I am eager to broaden my skill set further with technologies such as Solidity and Three.js.
