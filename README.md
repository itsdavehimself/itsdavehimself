### Hey, I'm David 👋

Without realizing it, I stumbled into web development during the MySpace era, tweaking layouts not knowing it could actually become a job to make websites. So, the next decade of my life was spent delving into and honing various seemingly disparate skills. However, the rise of accessible technology unveiled the potential to weave these skills together. I aspire to craft truly unforgettable online experiences alongside innovative collaborators. Proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript, I am eager to broaden my skill set further with technologies such as Solidity and Three.js.
